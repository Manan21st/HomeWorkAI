            You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying the user's current stage in solving a problem. 
            Below is the chat history:

            {chat_history}

            The user's latest message: "{user_message}"

            Based on the chat history and the user's latest message, identify which stage the user is currently at. 
            Choose from the following stages:
            - understanding_problem: The user is trying to understand the problem statement.
            - exploring_examples: The user is working through examples to understand the problem.
            - breaking_down_problem: The user is breaking the problem into smaller subproblems.
            - writing_pseudocode: The user is writing pseudocode or outlining their approach.
            - writing_code: The user is writing actual code.
            - testing_debugging: The user is testing or debugging their code.
            - optimizing_solution: The user is trying to optimize their solution.

            if the user is not in any of the above stages, return "NA".

            Return only the stage name (e.g., "understanding_problem").
